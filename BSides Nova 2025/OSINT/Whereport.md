# Whereport
Traveling back from DEF CON 33, I saw a cool photo opportunity at an airport. The question is, which airport? Submit the four letter ICAO for the airport
 pictured. (For example, KLAS)

# Solution
I zoomed in on the right and read Terminal B Tom Bradley. This gave me LAX and with a quick google search "4 letter ICAO LAX" I get KLAX
