# BigMak
I tried typing out the flag for you, but our Astronaut Coleson seems to have changed the terminal's keyboard layout? He went out to get a big mak so I guess we're screwed. Whatever, here's the flag, if you can somehow get it back to normal.

## Solution
In the way the problem was written, Cole was bolded and I felt that Mak was spelled weird, so after some googling, I found out Colemak was a thing. With this information, I obtained a Colemak to QWERTY converter to obtain the flag.
