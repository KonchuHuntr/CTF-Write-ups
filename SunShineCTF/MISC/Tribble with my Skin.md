# Tribble with my Skin
My Minecraft account got hacked and now my skin seems to be a little off...

Might be having trouble with the tribbles...

Mind checking it out? My Minecraft username is "oatzs".

PS: A Minecraft account/instance is not required for this challenge. The most recently used skin is the suspicious one.

## Solution
Given the user name I simply started off googling "Minecraft Skin Stealer" until I found a tool that would let me pull a users skin history and skin download based soley on the name
URL: https://crafty.gg/
and with this I downloaded and got the Flag
